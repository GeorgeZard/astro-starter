        <p>
          This component has been migrated from a React component in the main-theme project to a native Astro component.
          It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and imports Lucide icons for the service icons.
          The component is fully customizable through props, allowing for different services, titles, and descriptions.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The component handles icon rendering by mapping icon names to their corresponding components,
          and displays a numbered list of services with their descriptions.
